# CarPricePredictor ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ

## Description
**CarPricePredictor** is a **machine learning regression project** that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more. This project demonstrates how different regression algorithms perform on the same dataset and compares their results.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing: handling categorical variables, scaling features, and train-test split  
- Implementation of multiple regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
- Model evaluation using **MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score**  
- Comparison of model performance using **tables and bar charts**

---

## Dataset
- The project uses the **Car Price Dataset** containing car specifications and their prices.  
- Each row represents a car with features such as `engine size`, `horsepower`, `fuel type`, `car company`, etc.  
- Dataset link (if available): `[Add dataset link here]`
